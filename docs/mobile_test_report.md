# Mobile Responsiveness Test Report

## Overview
We have conducted a mobile responsiveness test for the Club Handbol Montbui website. The test simulated an iPhone X viewport (375x812) to evaluate the layout, navigation, and overall user experience on smaller screens.

## Test Results

### 1. Navigation
- **Mobile Menu**: The hamburger menu functions correctly. It opens and closes smoothly, and clicking a link closes the menu as expected.
- **Sticky Header**: The header remains fixed at the top, ensuring navigation is always accessible.

### 2. Layout & Typography
- **Hero Section**: The text scales down appropriately, ensuring it remains readable without overflowing. The background image covers the area well.
- **Grid Systems**: The grid layouts (e.g., in the "Nueva Temporada" and "Stats" sections) correctly collapse to a single column on mobile, stacking elements vertically for better readability.
- **Spacing**: Margins and paddings appear consistent, preventing content from feeling cramped.

### 3. Interactive Elements
- **Buttons**: Call-to-action buttons are easily tappable and well-sized for touch targets.
- **Social Hub**: 
    - **Instagram Reels**: The horizontal scroll container works perfectly on mobile, allowing users to swipe through the latest reels without taking up too much vertical space.
    - **YouTube Channel**: The layout correctly adapts to a single column. The main video takes prominence at the top, followed by the list of recent videos below it.
